    "### Airline review analysis\n",
    "The world of aviation industry majorly depends on the ratings and reviews given by other customers. Good ratings attract more customers and vice versa. It is for this reason that most airlines do a review analysis from their clients to asses their position in the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not only are the reviews reviewed but also the rating given. The airline management and board of directors always fully depend on the data science team for insights gotten from the consumers data analysed. They are the ones who do a follow-up on both the positive and negative issues raised by their consumers. The analysis doesn't only focus on the negative side of it but also on the positive side where employees maybe given promotions depending on the consumer rating. Pilots may also be considered for pay rises and much more. "
